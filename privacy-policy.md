        We send your prompts (and, if you choose, screenshots and relevant caption snippets) to
        <strong>AI model providers</strong> to generate responses, including:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> (e.g., GPT-4o and OpenAI OpenWeight offerings)</li>
          <li><strong>Amazon Web Services (Amazon Bedrock)</strong> — <strong>Nova Lite</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
