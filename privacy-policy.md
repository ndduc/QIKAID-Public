# Privacy Policy for QikAid

**Effective Date:** July 27, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how **QikAid** (“we,” “our,” or “us”) collects, uses, and protects information in our Chrome extension that overlays **Microsoft Teams**. QikAid currently supports **Teams only**.

---

## 1) Information We Collect
QikAid is designed to minimize data collection. We only process what’s needed to deliver features:

- **Live Captions (Teams):** Transcribed text captured natively from Microsoft Teams while QikAid is active.  
- **User Prompts (optional):** Questions you type into QikAid.  
- **Screenshots (optional):** Only when you explicitly choose to send a screenshot for analysis.

---

## 2) How We Use Your Information
We use your inputs solely to generate answers and on-screen assistance:

- We send your prompts (and, if you choose, screenshots and relevant caption snippets) to **AI model providers** to generate responses, including:  
  - **OpenAI** (e.g., GPT-4o and OpenAI OpenWeight offerings)  
  - **Amazon Web Services (Amazon Bedrock)** — **Nova Lite**
- We display the responses in the QikAid overlay inside your Teams meeting.

We do **not** sell your data or use it for advertising.

---

## 3) Data Storage & Security
- **Session-Scoped Processing:** Captions, prompts, and screenshots are processed **temporarily** while QikAid is active.  
- **No Persistent Storage by QikAid:** We do not permanently store your meeting content on QikAid servers. Temporary caching may occur only to provide real-time features and is discarded after the session.  
- **Transmission to Model Providers:** Content you choose to process is transmitted to **OpenAI** and/or **AWS (Amazon Bedrock)** for inference, depending on the feature.

---

## 4) Third-Party Services
QikAid currently relies on:
- **OpenAI** — to generate answers (e.g., GPT-4o, OpenAI OpenWeight).  
- **Amazon Web Services (Amazon Bedrock)** — to generate answers using **Nova Lite**.

We do not control third-party privacy practices. Please review their policies separately.
